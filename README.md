# Meteorites

This project was to get practice visualizing geospatial data. We're working with a dataset of meteorites reported to Nasa. A small amount of exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed at the start and then we move to creating our visualizations.


## Visualizations

At this point we're looking to just create maps showing where the meteorites in our data set landed. We create four different visualizations, each of which is an improvement on the last.

0. Individual Markers
  - A map of the world where each meteorite is represented by a single marker
1. Clustered Markers
  - A map of the world where geographically close meteorites, based on current zoom level, are clustered and represented by a clustered marker. Zooming in will unclustered markers.
2. Individual Markers with
  - A map of the world where each meteorite is represented by a single marker. Each country is colored according to a heat map, by population.
3. Clustered Markers with
  -  A map of the world where geographically close meteorites, based on current zoom level, are clustered and represented by a clustered marker. Zooming in will unclustered markers. Each country is colored according to a heat map, by population.
